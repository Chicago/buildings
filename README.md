Buildings
=========

Many data sources contain many types of information about the status of 
buildings in Chicago. For example, the [City's Data Portal](https://data.cityofchicago.org/) 
contains data on 311 calls, crimes, vacant buildings, ordinance violations, building permits,
and buildings shapefiles. Additionally, [Cook County's Data Portal](https://datacatalog.cookcountyil.gov/)
contains data on property tax payment status. However, no one source exists to compile the
data and provide an easy way to visualize or interpret it.

In order to link the data together, addresses, coordinates, and PIN numbers
will have to be mapped to individual buildings. Additionally, data points
that are not related to a building will have to be separated from 
data points that are. 

Project Description
-------------------

* Link data records by mapping location data to buildings
* Combine building-related data into a single dataset
* Aggregate the data in meaningful ways
* Integrate the data into [OpenGrid](http://opengrid.io/)
